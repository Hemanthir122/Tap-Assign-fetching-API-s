## üåê APIs Used and How They Work

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Geolocation API**
- **What it does:** Automatically retrieves the user's current latitude and longitude if the user does not manually enter a city.
- **How it works in the app:**
  - When the user clicks ‚ÄúFetch My Weather‚Äù without entering a city, the app requests the user's location.
  - The returned coordinates are used to fetch weather and AQI data accurately for the user's position.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Open-Meteo Weather API**
- **Endpoint:**
- **What it does:** Fetches:
- Current temperature (`temperature_2m`).
- Weather condition (`weather_code`).
- Hourly temperature for the next 6 hours to visualize trends.
- **How it works in the app:**
- After receiving coordinates (either from Geolocation API or geocoded city), the app fetches weather data from this endpoint.
- Displays the current temperature and readable weather condition.
- Uses hourly temperature data to render a **Canvas-based line chart**.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Open-Meteo Air Quality API**
- **Endpoint:**
- **What it does:** Fetches the **current Air Quality Index (AQI)** based on the US AQI standard.
- **How it works in the app:**
- Using coordinates, the app fetches current AQI data.
- Displays AQI value with a color-coded badge.
- Uses the AQI data to render a **Canvas-based circular AQI indicator** for quick visual insight.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Open-Meteo Geocoding API**
- **Endpoint:**
- **What it does:** Converts a **city name into latitude and longitude**.
- **How it works in the app:**
- If the user enters a city in the search bar, the app sends a request to this API to obtain the latitude and longitude.
- These coordinates are then used to fetch weather and AQI data accurately for the searched location.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Network Information API**
- **What it does:** Detects whether the user is **online or offline**.
- **How it works in the app:**
- Displays an **offline banner at the top** of the app if the network connection is lost, ensuring user awareness about connectivity issues.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Canvas API**
- **What it does:** Enables the drawing of **custom graphics** within the app.
- **How it works in the app:**
- Draws a **line chart** displaying hourly temperature trends.
- Renders a **circular AQI indicator** that visually represents the air quality level using colors and labels.
